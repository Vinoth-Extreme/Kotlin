Float Number Representation in Kotlin:
**************************************

1. Float data type is Single-Precision 32-bit floating point

2. Append "F" to values of float variables to tell compiler its a float.

3. If you don't know whether float or double will be held by a variable,
        Then use "Number" data type Instead of "Float" or "Double".
